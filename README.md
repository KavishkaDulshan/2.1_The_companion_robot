# Word about 2.1

There are  lots of companion robots out there with impressive features and latest technologies. As  my first ESP32 project I decided to create an DIY companion robot for myself, Because it is realy fun to have one of them with us when we are working alone. This is the prototype of my *2.1*. We can improve in many ways. 

I created this with very simple and minimal resources that everyone can easily find with very low cost. All the components are available in famouse e-commerce websites for very low prices. Therefor I thins It is very easy to make your own *2.1* without much effort.
